Just experimenting with TypeScript in my free time! This is my personal sandbox for trying out different TypeScript features and patterns.

## What's This About?

I created this playground to:

- Learn TypeScript by doing (not just reading docs)
- Try out different programming patterns and concepts
- Have some working examples I can reference later
- Practice for interviews or work projects

## What's Inside?

### üìÅ `playground-simple.ts`

**Perfect for beginners or quick reference**

- Basic TypeScript concepts (enums, interfaces, classes)
- Real-world business logic examples (tasks, validation)
- Object-oriented programming patterns
- Practical utility functions

### üìÅ `playground-advanced.ts`

**For exploring advanced TypeScript concepts**

- Advanced type system features (conditional types, mapped types)
- Enterprise patterns (Repository, Builder, Service layers)
- Error handling with Result patterns
- Business validation and user management
- Performance optimization techniques

## How to Run This

### Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js and TypeScript installed:

```bash
# Install TypeScript globally (if you haven't already)
npm install -g typescript ts-node

# Or check if you have it
tsc --version
ts-node --version
```

### Running the Examples

```bash
# Run the simple examples
ts-node playground-simple.ts

# Run the advanced examples
ts-node playground-advanced.ts
```

That's it! The files will execute and show you the output in your terminal.

## Why I Made This

I learn best by building things, not just reading about them. This playground lets me:

1. **Experiment safely** - Try new concepts without breaking real projects
2. **Build muscle memory** - Practice TypeScript syntax until it's natural
3. **Reference later** - Quick examples when I forget how something works
4. **Show progress** - Evidence of my TypeScript learning journey

## What I've Learned

Through building this playground, I've gotten comfortable with:

- TypeScript's type system and how it helps catch bugs
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
- Object-oriented and functional programming approaches
- Business logic implementation
- API design patterns
- Error handling strategies
